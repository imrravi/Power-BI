     - High Margin (> 0.5)
     - Medium Margin (0.2 - 0.5)
     - Low Margin (< 0.2)

2. **Q&A Visual**
   - Used the Q&A feature to find: *"What is the average product cost by product color?"*
   - Displayed results using a bar chart

3. **Decomposition Tree**

   - Identified key drivers for high prices

4. **Key Influencer Visual**

   - Summarized findings in the report

5. **Column from Example & Formatting**
   - Extracted the first letter from `ProductColor` (e.g., Red → R)
